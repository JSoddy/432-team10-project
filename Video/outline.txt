~ 1 minute: Intro
		Bakground
		What is our data structure
		Purpose
		History
		Benefits
		(Mention Paper)

~ 1 minute: Visualization
		Small size set
		Make clear what happens with each operation
			add, delete, relevel, derandomize?
		Both standard and circular versions

brief: Impress
		Visual of what our circular data structure looks like with many elements
			"After another 600,000 add operations, it looks like this!"

~ 1 minute: We made this!
		Discuss the results of our trial runs.
		Respons times in different situations
		Cost of circular during normal operations
		benefits when under attack
		How did our results compare with our expectations?

brief: Deviation
		How do we differ from the paper's proposal?
		Is anything in our implementatio less than ideal?

brief: It's even better!
		Discuss the benefits of our algorithm vs. a standard randomized-height
		skip-list.
		Keep this high-level.
		Maybe bust out "the equation" just for fun.

~30 sec: Conclusion
		Summarize
		Things we didn't do?
		Areas for further research
		New application ideas
