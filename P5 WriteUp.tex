So far our work has been focused on two parts of our project, Skip List implementation and generating unique data sets to test our program with. Implementing skip lists involved creating a data structure that is linked not only from left to right but also up and down. It also caused us to make unique add, search, and delete functions that are different from normal link list functions. The data sets we have created will help us illustrate the differences in how our algorithm will handle an attack versus a normal data structure. They will also ensure that our data structure is not gimmicky in the sense that it only performs better on very specific data.

Now that we have the normal skip list implementation complete our next goals are to make the Skip list circular and implementing a randomized starting node for our lists. Both of these should be fairly easy to accomplish with our current skip list implementation. Making the lists circular will involve connecting the starting and ending nodes and also modifying our search, delete, and add functions so that they account for an unknown starting point. Creating a randomized starting node will involve decisions about how the data structure should be modeled after the change. Once we have our data structure complete we can move to the video production of our project. Our video will begin by explaining the purpose of our data structure and explaining the essentials of how it functions. Then we will show, and explain, a series of illustrations that show the differences in performance of our algorithm versus other common algorithms when under an attack. This will likely involve programming the basic form of some common data structures which should not be too difficult.

The major difficulties we have faced throughout this project are the standard issues every group runs into. First is finding a common time to meet and work on the project, everyone has unique schedules that don't always coincide with each other. Secondly is finding a part of the project that everyone will excel at doing, each of us have a unique skill set that might be better served performing one task over another. Lastly is getting the programs used to work for everyone in the group. While using version control has undoubtedly helped keep everyone on the same page throughout working on our project setting up git-hub and learning latex has been taxing at times.
